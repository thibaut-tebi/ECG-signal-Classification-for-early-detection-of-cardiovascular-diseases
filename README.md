# ECG-signal-Classification-for-early-detection-of-cardiovascular-diseases


The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential diagnostic tool that records heart activity by detecting electrical changes with each heartbeat. It plays a crucial role in identifying various cardiac abnormalities, such as arrhythmias (including myocardia infraction) and conduction disturbances. This project introduces an advanced method for classifying ECG signals utilizing robust classification techniques. Initially, ECG data was obtained from the PhysioNet's PTB-XL diagnostic ECG Database. The data underwent preprocessing, where Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) effectively attenuated high-frequency noise, simultaneously aiding in feature extraction. This preprocessing enhanced the signal quality, crucial for accurate classification. Feature extraction was then performed using statistical parameters, leveraging the refined signal data. The following distinct classifiers were used applied to classify the data: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). These classifiers were employed to categorize the ECG signals into normal or abnormal categories. The experimental results demonstrate remarkable accuracy levels: SVM at 90%, KNN at 83%, and RF at 86%. Notably, the Support Vector Machine classifier exhibited superior performance compared to its counterparts. This finding underscores the potential of SVM in ECG signal classification, paving the way for more accurate and reliable cardiac diagnostics.
